## Rebecca Piper

A fast-thinking, enthusiastic Maths graduate from Durham University who enjoys web design and problem solving. As a quick learner who works well with others, I am looking for a career where I can further develop my coding skills and contribute to a successful, dynamic team.

## Skills

#### Coding

In April 2016, I completed the intensive 12-week [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/employers/) course. As part of this course, I remotely pair programmed with other students daily to create projects using TDD, Ruby and Javascript. At their request, I filmed weekly [video blogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfn40Pe3a50&index=2&list=PLc4BYny7PXeQLLdl_meucEyKl8K9sI0SV)

Using Bootstrap to design and create the Front-End of the application.|

#### Photoshop

I have enjoyed making gifs using Photoshop for the last few years. This includes the use of Adjustment Layers, Filters and Masks.

#### Leadership

As President and Musical Director of Mary's Mixed Voices, a University choir, I organised rehearsals and performances for the entire group.This included arranging separate rehearsals for vocal groups so that everyone felt prepared for important performances. We won 'Best Vocal Ensemble' in an Inter-College competition.

#### Communication

In Summer 2014, I spent two months teaching Maths and English to struggling primary school children in KaNyamazane, South Africa. It was very challenging to communicate with the children as their first language was Siswati. I succeeded in this by developing games focusing on different parts of the curriculum.

#### Teamwork

I have been involved in many projects which involve teamwork. Most recently, I performed in a local production of `Into the Woods'. Not only was this a huge time commitment, but for the performance to be successful, it was important for everyone to work together. Everyone had a responsibility to the rest of the team to show up and learn lines, as well as help others understand what they were meant to be doing.

#### Quick Learner

In a recent Thomas T.S.T test, I acheived:

- 99th Percentile in Perceptual Speed and Reasoning
- 98th Percentile in Number Speed & Accuracy
- 96th Percentile Overall

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jan 2016 to Apr 2016)

After using R during my studies, I spent the summer after graduation looking into different coding languages. I loved the logic involved in writing code, as well as how clean it could look, and I wanted to learn more.

- Independent Learning
- OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC
- Software Craftsmanship
- Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Angular.js
- Rspec, Jasmine

#### St Mary's College, Durham University (2011 to 2015)

- Mathematics, with a focus on Statistics
- BSc Class II Division 2 (Honours)
