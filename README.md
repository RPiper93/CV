## Rebecca Piper

A fun and reliable Maths graduate from Durham University who enjoys designing things and solving problems. As a quick learner who works well with others, I'd like to find a career where I can further develop my coding skills and contribute to a team.

## Skills

#### Coding

In April 2016, I completed the intensive 12-week [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/employers/) course. As part of this course, I remotely pair programmed with other students daily to create projects using TDD, Ruby and Javascript.

- [Thermostat](https://github.com/RPiper93/thermostat/tree/master) is a project I completed during my first week using JavaScript and jQuery.
- [Recipedia](https://github.com/RPiper93/Recipes-project) is the final project I was involved with during the course. This web app was produced by team of four over two weeks using Rails and AngularJS.

#### Leadership

As President and Musical Director of Mary's Mixed Voices, a University choir, I organised rehearsals and performances for the entire group.This included arranging separate rehearsals for vocal groups so that everyone felt prepared for important performances. We won 'Best Vocal Ensemble' in an Inter-College competition.


#### Communication

In Summer 2014, I spent two months teaching Maths and English to struggling primary school children in KaNyamazane, South Africa. It was very challenging to communicate with the children as their first language was Siswati. I found different ways to teach them the curriculum.

#### Teamwork

I have been involved in many projects which involve teamwork. Most recently, I starred in a local performance of `Into the Woods'. Not only was this a huge time commitment, but for the performance to be successful, it was important for everyone to work together. Everyone had a responsibility to the rest of the team to show up and learn lines, as well as help others understand what they were meant to be doing.

#### Quick Learner

In a recent Thomas T.S.T test, I acheive:

- 99th Percentile in Perceptual Speed and Reasoning
- 98th Percentile in Number Speed & Accuracy
- 96th Percentile Overall

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jan 2016 to Apr 2016)

After using R during my studies, I spent the summer after graduation looking into different coding languages. I loved the logic involved in writing code, as well as how clean it could look, and I wanted to learn more.

- Independent Learning
- OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC
- Software Craftsmanship
- Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Angular.js
- Rspec, Jasmine

#### St Mary's College, Durham University (2011 to 2015)

- Mathematics, especially Statistics
- BSc Class II Division 2 (Honours)
